The input(s) to this transaction is not spendable without the signature of both, the gateway and the web-service. For large value transactions, the web-service initiates a voice-call with the client to verify the client's spending PIN. Instead of confirming the message via SMS/text, you enter a Secret PIN with dial-tones via a voice call. Once successful, the web-service adds its part of the signature and the transaction can be spent. Throughout the process, the client is required to verify the possession of the phone as well as the knowledge of the spending PIN, giving him two factors for authentication.

The client sends simple text commands via SMS. The gateway verifies those commands, constructs a transaction and forwards it to the web-service. The web-service verifies, independently from the gateway, and then publishes the transaction to the Bitcoin network. It may seem complicated, but for the end-user it’s really as simple as sending an SMS. And it is secure because we use the phone’s SIM identification through the SMS channel; and, if necessary, we use a Secret PIN as another identifier. The secret PIN is entered using dial tones via a voice call."

The input(s) to this transaction is not spendable without the signature of both, the gateway and the web-service. For large value transactions, the web-service initiates a voice-call with the client to verify the client's spending PIN. Once successful, the web-service adds its part of the signature and the transaction can be spent. Throughout the process, the client is required to verify the possession of the phone as well as the knowledge of the spending PIN, giving him two factors for authentication.
